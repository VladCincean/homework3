# Lab 3 - Advanced launching of parallel tasks

## Goal
The goal of this lab is to use more advanced mechanisms for launching parallel operations â€” the thread pool and the _future_.

## Requirement
Take the same problems as for lab 2, but, instead of directly creating threads, use each of the following:

1. Thread pool, in C++.
2. Thread pool, in C# or Java.
3. std::async() and std::future(), in C++.
4. Tasks and futures in C# or Java.
Compare the performance of the various mechanisms.
