# Lab 8 - Parallelizing techniques (3 - parallel explore)

## Goal
The goal of this lab is to implement a simple but non-trivial parallel algorithm.

## Requirement
Solve the problem below:

Given a directed graph, find a Hamiltonean cycle, if one exists. Use multiple threads to parallelize the search.
