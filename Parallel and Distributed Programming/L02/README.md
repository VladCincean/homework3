# Lab 2 - Parallelizing into fully independent sub-tasks

Write two problems: one for computing the sum of two matrices, the other for computing the product of two matrices.

Divide the task between a configured number of threads (going from 1 to the number of elements in the resulting matrix). See the effects on the execution time.
