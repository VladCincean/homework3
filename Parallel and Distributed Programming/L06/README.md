# Lab 6 - Parallelizing techniques

## Goal
The goal of this lab is to implement a simple but non-trivial parallel algorithm.

## Requirement
Perform the multiplication of 2 polynomials. Use both the regular O(n<sup>2</sup>) algorithm and the Karatsuba algorithm, and each in both the sequencial form and a parallelized form. Compare the 4 variants.
